The "About Me" project is a personal webpage created by me as part of my web development course to learn HTML and CSS. The webpage serves as an introduction to myself, featuring sections such as a biography, hobbies, photo gallery, a short video, an excerpt from Sherlock Holmes, and a contact form. Through this project, I aimed to not only showcase my personal interests and skills but also to gain practical experience in fundamental web development techniques.
I used semantic elements and HTML to organize the content when creating the webpage, making sure that the structure was clear and appropriate for all users. The webpage's appearance was customized using CSS, with special focus on the visual appeal of fonts, colors, borders, and background styling.
CSS Flexbox and Grid were used to help with content arrangement so that responsive layouts for the various webpage sections could be made. Using the proper HTML tags, media items (a YouTube video and some photos) were embedded and formatted to fit neatly inside their containers.
Custom fonts, colors, and dropcaps were applied to text material to enhance readability and provide visual interest. Typography was carefully studied. To improve usability, form elements for the contact form were created with user-friendly styling and validation.
I gave accessibility top priority throughout the project, putting semantic HTML elements into practice to guarantee accessible for all users. In order to ensure readability and usefulness, especially for people with disabilities, strong color contrast was also maintained.
Overall, the "About Me" project not only serves as a personal introduction to myself but also stands as a testament to my dedication to learning web development through hands-on practice and application of HTML and CSS principles.

The project's color scheme primarily consists of light yellow (#E1D884) for the background, dark blue (#1E5566) for text, green (#52E02D) for accent highlights, and red (#E62F15) for borders and accents. These colors were chosen to create a visually appealing design while ensuring readability and accessibility of the content.

Additional colors were used to differentiate sections and elements within the webpage. Light blue (#87CEFA) was used as the secondary background color for the gallery section, while gold (#FFD700) and red (#e74c3c) were used for text in the gallery and hobbies sections, respectively. Red (#E62F15) was also used as the border color for gallery images, providing visual separation and emphasis.

The combination of these colors creates a cohesive and engaging visual experience for visitors to the webpage, enhancing the overall presentation of content and reinforcing the project's design aesthetic.
